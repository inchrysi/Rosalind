# ðŸ§¬Rosalind
This repository contains my Python solutions to various problems from [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/), an online platform for learning bioinformatics through programming challenges.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

Some of the concepts and problem types Iâ€™ve worked on:

- **DNA & RNA sequences**: transcription, translation, GC content
- **Mendelian inheritance**: dominant allele probability, expected offspring
- **Motif finding**: locating motifs, shared motifs, restriction sites
- **Probability**: random strings, independent events
- **Graphs & combinatorics**: permutations, overlap graphs (unsuccessfully)
- **Recurrence relations**: Fibonacci rabbits (regular and mortal versions)
- **Profiles & consensus sequences**

## ðŸŒ± Still Learning!

Heads up â€” Iâ€™m still new to Python and bioinformatics, so some of my code might be a bit messy or not super optimized yet.
Right now, Iâ€™m focused on getting things to work, learning the logic behind each problem, and improving step by step. 
**Suggestions, feedback and better solutions are welcome!**
